# Algorithms-DataStructure
This repository includes algorithms and data structure textbooks, learning code   
### First chapter - Introduction to Algorithms
- Binary Search: input is an `ordered list` of elements, If the element to be
is contained in the list, `returns its position`; `otherwise it returns null`.
- Big-O notation: The Big O representation allows you to compare operands, which indicates the `rate of increase` of the algorithm's `running time`.
